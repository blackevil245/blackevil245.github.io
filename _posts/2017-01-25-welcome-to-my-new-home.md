Finally after ages fighting whether i should buy a `.io` domain, my wallet had suffered its lost. `jamesnguyen.io` is now my official new home.

Knowing me from before, you may or may not notice that previously i did have a home for my website. It was `hieu-nguyen.com`, and its only mean of existance is to host my virual CV. Poor guy, he could be so much better should i had not been lazy and designed a blog layout for it. Hell i even stopped updating it after i found my current job ...

Sadness aside, instead of following the old past and write my new website from scratch, i decided to use a site generator and focus on writting contents. My tool of choice is the infamous `jekyll`.

To warm up my home, next blog will be on how i setup jekyll on github pages to host my blog, and steps by steps on how to setup a custom domain to serve the content to it.

```javascript
function* james() {
  while (blogIdea > 0) {
    console.info('Grasp milk')
    yield newBlog;
  }
}
```
